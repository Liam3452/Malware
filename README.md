# Malware
This is a malware that I learned How to code thanks to a course, keep in mind this is for reseasrch and to understand how malware works, dont do anything illegal with this code.


What this Virus does is basicly a reverse shell into the computer of the victim and it creates a percistance on windows regestry so that every time the person runs there device the Virus will run to. 


This virus will connect to a server that runs on linux
